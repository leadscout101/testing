HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT - CONTACTS

# For your homework you should write an program that will keep track
# of contacts you (user) enter into the program.
# The program should store names, telehone numbers and emails in memory.
#When you run the program there should be no contacts in the memory and
# the user should be able to enter, delete, print and find concats
# by interacting with the program in the console.

# The program should accept 5 commands from the user: 'input', 'print',
# 'delete', 'find' and 'end' command.

# 'input' command should promt the user to enter name, telephone number and
# email of the contact they want to add and add the contact into the memory
#If there allready is such a contact in the memory, the program should
# inform the user and dont add that contact to memory - two contacts
# of the same name should not be added to memory

# 'print' command should print all concats in memory, if
# there are no contacts in memory it should inform user that there are
# no contacts

# 'delete' command should promt the user to enter the name of the
# contact they want to delete from memory and then delete the contact
#If there is no such contact in the memory the program should
# inform the user that there is no such contact

# 'find' command should promt the user to enter the name of the contact they want
# to find and then print that contact.
# If there is no such contact in the memory the program should inform
# the user

# 'end' command should end the program

# USE FUNCTIONS WHEN IMPLEMENTING  'input', 'print','delete', 'find' COMMANDS!!!!
